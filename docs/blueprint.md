# **App Name**: EmojiTyper

## Core Features:

- Shadcn Textarea Integration: A Shadcn textarea component acts as the primary input field for user typing.
- Cursor Emoji Effect: An image/text emoji is rendered dynamically next to the typing cursor as the user types in the textarea.
- Typing Speed Tracking: The app measures the user's typing speed to determine the frequency and intensity of emoji effects. Faster typing results in more frequent and dynamic emojis.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vivid, energetic blue (#29ABE2) reminiscent of typing on illuminated screens.
- Background color: A dark, desaturated blue-gray (#2B3035) to provide excellent contrast, reduce eye strain, and enhance the visual pop of emojis.
- Accent color: A vibrant purple (#A23B72), complementary to the primary blue, for active states.
- Use clean, modern sans-serif fonts
- The textarea occupies a large portion of the screen.
- Emojis briefly 'float' next to the cursor as they appear.
